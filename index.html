            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Gabriel Spaer, but you can call me Aril. I would like to share a bit about my life with you.</p>
            <p>At the age of 6, I started my formal education at SDN 2 KEMA. My elementary school years were filled with memories of learning and playing with friends. Over those 6 years, I learned many foundational skills and knowledge. After graduating from elementary school, I continued my education at a private junior high school, MTS Nurul Huda Kauditan. Junior high school was an important transitional period where I began to understand more about myself and my interests in various subjects.</p>
            <p>After graduating from junior high, I went on to study at SMAN 1 Airmadidi for my high school education. High school was the most enjoyable and memorable period of my life. There, I met many kind and supportive friends. We spent a lot of time together, studying, playing, and planning our futures. Each day was colorful with various extracurricular activities, group projects, and school events that brought us closer together. However, after 3 years of cherished moments, we had to part ways to pursue our individual dreams and goals. Some of my friends chose paths to become doctors, engineers, and various other professions.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am continuing my academic journey as a student at Politeknik Negeri Manado, majoring in Engineering. These college years are also filled with challenges and new learning experiences. I feel fortunate to learn from experienced lecturers and to meet new friends who share a strong passion for learning. Every day at the campus is an opportunity to deepen my knowledge and skills that will be useful in the future.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, after graduating from college, I aspire to become a UI/UX Designer. This field greatly interests me because it allows me to combine creativity and technical skills to create intuitive and appealing user interfaces. I hope to contribute to the development of digital products that are both useful and enjoyable to use. With determination and dedication, I am confident that I can achieve this dream and make a positive impact in the tech world.</p>
